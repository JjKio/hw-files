        Croissants are a style of viennoiserie pastries, which of course relates
        back to the Austrian city of Vienna, otherwise known as the birthplace
        of croissants. The ancestor to the modern-day croissant was called the
        kipferl, which dates back to the 13th century and comes in various
        shapes and sizes. They are often filled with nuts or other fillings, and
        kipferl (which have possible but unconfirmed roots in ancient Egypt),
        are also considered to be a form of rugelach, a Jewish pastry of
        Ashkenazic origin. They are denser and sweeter to what we think of as
        the modern croissant.
